We're gonna need a bigger :boat:!

## Install

Get all NBA players:

league <- "nba"
sport <- "basketball"
ep <- "players"
q_body <- list()
players <- ss_get_result(sport = sport, league = league, ep = ep,
                         query = q_body, version = 1, walk = TRUE)
players_df <- do.call("rbind", lapply(players, function(x) x$players))
```

Get all triple doubles this NBA season:

```
league <- "nba"
